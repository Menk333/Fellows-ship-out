                    <p>Welcome to my journey through code, Thank you for your interest in my website, its still a work in progress but its coming together pretty well. When I first started coding I was barely in middle school, my mother had me completing projects on code academy almost everyday. I loved it! although, its only recently that I've felt the motivation to leap into code full time and find a carrer in it.</p>
